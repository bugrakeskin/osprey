## Welcome to the Eutierria Creations

All around us, we see the devastating results of humans’ exploitative and adversarial relationship to nature. But what if there were other ways to imagine this relationship? Can we think of the human/nature relationship as a marriage—not free from conflict, but as partners in a shared endeavor? Can we imagine humans and nature sharing the same “home”? What can we learn from traditional Chinese ecological wisdom in this regard? Drawing on myth, philosophy, cosmology, and history, Xia examines environmental and ecological thinking in China and the West, proposing an approach to “ecological history” that offers new ways of thinking ourselves back into nature—or back home.
